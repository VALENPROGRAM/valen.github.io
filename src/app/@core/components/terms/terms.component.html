    Dear Enquirer
    <br />
    Thank you for expressing interest in our concept. Hopefully, you will find
    what you want from the materials that have been provided in this website,
    however, in the event you require more data or wish to discuss any aspect of
    the VALEN Program, please use the email address shown.
    <br />
    As is normal for this type of interaction we need to protect the
    intellectual property within the VALEN concept and ask you, therefore, to
    agree to the usual terms and conditions as regards the use of this IP.
    ..................................................................
    <br /><br />
    Within this website VALEN will be giving to you, certain written non-public
    information, all of which is collectively, or will be upon delivery to you,
    treated by you as confidential (all such information referred to herein as
    the “Confidential Material”).
    <br /><br />
    Such Confidential Material does not include information which:
    <br />
    <br />
    (i) prior to its delivery to you by us was already in your possession and
    advised by you to us in writing promptly after receipt,
    <br /><br />
    (ii) was or becomes publicly available through authorized disclosure,
    <br /><br />
    (iii) becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source
    other than us or any client, provided you do not know that said source is
    bound by a confidentiality agreement with or obligation of secrecy, and/or
    <br /><br />
    (iv) was or is independently developed by you.
    <br /><br />
    All Confidential Material given to you will be treated confidentially by you
    as long as it remains non- public or public in an unauthorised manner.
    <br /><br />
    Except as otherwise required by law, you will not disclose this information
    to any third party without our written consent.
    <br /><br />
    You may, however, disclose Confidential Material to any person within your
    business organisation who needs to know such information for the purposes of
    any services rendered to us or any discussion regarding the use or otherwise
    of the concept, provided that any such person shall be informed by you of
    the confidential nature of such information, and shall be bound by these
    presents.
    <br /><br />
    Except with our consent or as otherwise required by law, regulation,
    administrative or court order, you will not make any public disclosure in
    connection with VALEN, its business arrangements or other activities, its
    financial position or holdings, or to the effect that you are having or have
    had discussions with us, or that you have received or revealed any
    Confidential Material.
    <br /><br />
    If you are required in any proceedings to disclose any Confidential
    Material, you will give us prompt notice of such request to our email
    address or such other address we may advise you of in writing from time to
    time, provided that there is no prohibition thereof, so that we may seek
    with your full support and assistance an appropriate protective order.
    <br /><br />
    Upon our request, for any reason, you will promptly:
    <br /><br />
    (i) destroy or redeliver to us at our email address or such other address we
    may advise you of in writing from time to time, any Confidential Material
    which we have provided to you, (ii) destroy any materials prepared by you
    incorporating or deriving from any Confidential Material, and (iii) delete
    all Confidential Material from any computer records or files stored
    electronically and provided that you may retain a copy of the minimum amount
    necessary to comply with mandatory audit, legal or regulatory purposes.
    <br /><br />
    These terms and conditions shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
    each of us and our respective successors and permitted assigns.
    <br /><br />
    This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the Parties and
    supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, with
    respect to the subject matter herein. This Agreement shall be construed,
    interpreted, enforced and governed by and in accordance with the laws of
    Canton Geneva, Switzerland without reference to its conflicts of laws
    doctrine, and the Parties agree to submit to the competent jurisdiction of
